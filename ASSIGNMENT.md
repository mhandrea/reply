# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> It was a little difficult to learn at first because the author of the code used slightly different variable names than what I would have used. He used answer and reply interchangeably which could be a little confusing. I would try to keep input from the user, and potential answers/options variable names as specific as possible.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> I would say it is like describing the functionality without the technical specifics. The overall picture, not the technical minutiae of how the code works.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
>  4


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Online, google, stackedoverflow, the API docs, readme files, etc.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I know I did poorly on this assignment, that is my fault and I will be better prepared in the future. I just ran out of time and quickly put this together/did not manage my time well at all this past week. So no problems with the assigment, just my lack of effort and needing to catch up a bit. Which I will have no problem doing, don't worry!
